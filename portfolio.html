    <h1>Our 1.1.9 project is an Eggdog Simulator which uses an animated picture of 
      Eggdog and is controllable using the arrow keys on your keybaord. We used a beach
     wallpaper as our background and coded eggdog to spawn initially in the middle. This eggdog will
     then jump up and spawn another eggdog which the user is given total control over. </h1>

      <h1>Our 1.2.5 project is comprised of froggers trying to cross the road. This is essentially
        very similar to the flappy birds game which is a knock off of the superior froggers
      game. Our Froggers game is superior to flappy bird in every aspect. Froggers as a game
    is more fun and engaging than flappy bird. We used collision code to detect when froggers
  is hit by a car and also abstraction to simplify ourc code. </h1>

      <h1> For the scratch project we made a an animal ping pong type of game
        where two users can use the WASD keys and arrows keys to manuever one of two
        characters. These characters include a starfish and a crab and the player who 
        commands them trys to score. The objective of the game is to beat the other
        player and get to 10 goals first. In our code, we used animation, multiple
        backgrounds, prcoedures, different costume types, events, scores, player inputs,
        sound, and counters. </h1>
