    <h1>Our 1.1.9 project is an Eggdog Simulator which uses an animated picture of 
      Eggdog and is controllable using the arrow keys on your keybaord. We used a beach
     wallpaper as our background and coded eggdog to spawn initially in the middle. This eggdog will
     then jump up and spawn another eggdog which the user is given total control over. </h1>

      <h1>1.2.5 Froggers Project </h1>

      <h1>Our 1.2.5 project is comprised of froggers trying to cross the road. This is essentially
        very similar to the flappy birds game which is a knock off of the superior froggers
      game. Our Froggers game is superior to flappy bird in every aspect. Froggers as a game
    is more fun and engaging than flappy bird. We used collision code to detect when froggers
  is hit by a car and also abstraction to simplify ourc code. </h1>
